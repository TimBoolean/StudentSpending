                                                                Intro

I was interested in the spending of college students by year in class, gender, and their choice of payments. This analysis gathers 1000 students' information on their spending habits.


                                                                Goal
The goal of this project is to understand which method of payments vendors should have available to college students. This analysis should reveal which audience you should target based on the data sample.
